Creating the models:

First model that was set up was the Linear Regression model. I did not tune on any variables for this.

The second model that was set up was the Random Forest model. I tuned on the mtry, trees, and min_n variables.

The third model that was set up was the Elastic Regression model. I tuned on the penalty and mixture.

The fourth model that was set up was the KNN Regression model. I tuned on neighbors.

#Linear Model 

lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")

#Elastic  Model 

elastic_net <- linear_reg(mixture = tune(), 
                         penalty = tune()) %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  set_engine("glmnet")

#Random Forest Model

rf <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), 
                       trees = tune(), 
                       min_n = tune()) %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")

#KNN Model

knn <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>% 
  set_engine("kknn")
